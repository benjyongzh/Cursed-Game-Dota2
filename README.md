# Cursed game in DotA2
This is a DotA2 custom game I created back in 2020. Last updated in September 2020.
At the time of uploading this to Github, this game likely will no longer be functioning, or at least be plagued with in-game bugs due to Valve's annual DotA 2 game-breaking updates to their API and mechanics.
Nevertheless, the game stays on the Steam Workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2109195877).

## Learning Points
- In this project, I learned about Lua, JavaScript and CSS, creating art content to be used as an in-game asset, and making use of APIs and methods provided by Valve to create desired outcomes for a game.
- I learned of the importance of game testing, and getting player feedback for game balancing.
- Online multiplayer involves working with both the client and server. It is crucial to differentiate what work is handled by each.
